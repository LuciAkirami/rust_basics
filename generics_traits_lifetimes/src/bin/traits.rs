-------- TRAITS ------
A typeâ€™s behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different types share the s
ame behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types. Trait definitions are a way to 
group method signatures together to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.

// ---------- Trait Bounds -----------
// Trait Bounds is restricting a generic type based on the trait implementation
// Implementing a generic func that only takes the Types that implement a specific trait
// the fn tells that, it is generic over any type "T", that implements the "Trait" "MammalAnatomy"
fn is_this_mammal<T: MammalAnatomy> (mammal: &T){
    println!("Yes this is a mammal");
}
/*
fn is_this_mammal<T: MammalAnatomy> (mammal: &T){}

this can be re-written as 

fn is_this_mammal(mammal: &impl MammalAnatomy){} -> more easy to write, a syntactical sugar

we can also specify more than one trait bound
fn is_this_living<T: MammalAnatomy + BirdAnatomy> (living: T)
this tells the function takes in any type T that implements both MammalAnatomy and(not or) BirdAnatomy


fn some_func() -> impl trait_name{}
this fn returns a generic type that implements the trait "trait_name"
Note: this fn only works when all the type that are returned in this func have the same function definition
for that trait
Note: If i return any of two types "lets say a and b" that implement the trait "trait_name". If the type "a",
implements the fns in "trait_name" differently than type "b", then rust will throw an error

/*
------ WHERE Caluse -----------
when defining trait bounds for eacch type, they can get big like the below
fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {}

so we can use a "Where" caluse here
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{}
