    // from the vector. But references are non-owning pointers â€” we can't take 
    // ownership through a reference. Therefore Rust complains that we 
    // "cannot move out of [...] a shared reference".

    In sum, if a value does not own heap data, then it can be copied without a move. 
    For example:
        An i32 does not own heap data, so it can be copied without a move.
        A String does own heap data, so it can not be copied without a move.
        An &String does not own heap data, so it can be copied without a move.
