    /* ------------- IMPORTANT NOTE --------------
    From output, we notice that, the for loop in the spawned thread did not run fully.
    This is because, the program exits when the main/parent thread finishes, thus when
    main thread finished 5 loops, the program finishes and all spawned threads are shutdown
